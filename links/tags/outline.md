- [To avoid being replaced by LLMs, do what they can't](https://seangoedecke.com/what-llms-cant-do/) 👤 seangoedecke.com 💬 919 🔖 #llm, #outline 🗓️ 2025-02-15
    > **Заметка:** LLM vs Dev
    > **Резюме:** Software engineers should adapt to the rise of large language models (LLMs) by learning AI and focusing on legacy code, as this type of work is likely to be harder for LLMs to master. In the long term, engineers will need to take on responsibilities that require trust and accountability, which LLMs cannot provide. Ultimately, while many engineering roles may be replaced, there will always be a need for human oversight in managing AI systems.

- [Glue work considered harmful](https://www.seangoedecke.com/glue-work-considered-harmful) 👤 seangoedecke.com 💬 639 🔖 #leaddev, #outline 🗓️ 2025-01-28
    > **Заметка:** Интересная мысль: делать glue work для проектов, за успех которых ты отвечаешь. Тогда будет оценена на сама glue work, а итоговый успех проекта.
    > **Резюме:** "Glue work" refers to essential but unrecognized tasks that help teams operate efficiently, like updating documents and onboarding new engineers. Companies often overlook this work during promotions, as they prioritize visible feature delivery instead.

- [Server-Sent Events (SSE) Are Underrated](https://igorstechnoclub.com/server-sent-events-sse-are-underrated/) 👤 Igor's Techno Club 💬 736 🔖 #sse, #outline 🗓️ 2024-12-27
    > **Резюме:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) offer a simple way for servers to send updates to clients over HTTP, unlike the more complex WebSockets. SSE is efficient and works well with existing infrastructure, making it a great choice for applications like real-time news feeds and stock tickers. Despite being underrated, SSE's one-way communication can be sufficient for many use cases.
- [Go Composition does not compose well with Implicit Interfaces](https://clace.io/blog/go-composition/) 👤 Internal Tools Deployment Platform | Clace 💬 550 🔖 #go, #outline 🗓️ 2024-12-26
    > **Заметка:** Учитывать описанную проблему при использовании композиции типов.
    > **Резюме:** Clace encountered a problem where Server-Sent Events (SSE) stopped working due to a change in how HTTP response status codes were tracked. This issue arose because adding a composition over `http.ResponseWriter` caused it to lose support for the implicit interface `http.Flusher`, which is needed for SSE. To fix the problem, the custom struct must explicitly implement the `http.Flusher` interface to maintain its functionality.
- [Getting the path to the note I have open in Obsidian](https://alexwlchan.net/2023/obsidian-open-note/) 👤 alexwlchan.net 💬 908 🔖 #try, #outline, #obsidian 🗓️ 2024-12-10
