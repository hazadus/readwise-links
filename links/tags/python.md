- [Python Hashes and Equality](https://hynek.me/articles/hashes-and-equality/) 👤 Hynek Schlawack 💬 943 🔖 #python 🗓️ 2024-02-07
    > **Резюме:** Python equality and hashing can be complex and lead to bugs if not understood. Object equality in Python requires implementing the __eq__(self, other) method, while inequality checks use the __ne__(self, other) method. Object hashes, obtained using the hash() function, are important for sets and dictionaries to quickly find keys. Hashes must remain constant throughout an object's lifetime. Mutable values should not be used for hashing, and immutable objects are preferred. Hashes can be less picky than equality checks and can be computed over a subset of immutable attributes. It is best to hash by identity rather than compare by value, as this follows Python's assumptions. Python 3 automatically makes classes unhashable if __eq__ is implemented without __hash__.
