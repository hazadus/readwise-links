- [Microservices Are a Tax Your Startup Probably Can’t Afford](https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/) 👤 Oleg Pustovit 💬 3501 🔖 #inspiration, #architecture, #microservices 🗓️ 2025-05-10
    > **Заметка:** Автор убедительно описывает случаи, когда стоит использовать микросервисы, а когда лучше от них отказаться. 
    > **Резюме:** Microservices can complicate early-stage startups, slowing down productivity and making it harder to deliver value. A simpler monolithic architecture often allows teams to focus on essential features without unnecessary complexity. Microservices should only be adopted when a startup has grown and requires the scalability they offer, not as a default choice.
- [Микросервисы в представлении среднего разработчика, и как всё на самом деле](https://habr.com/ru/articles/825532/) 👤 Хабр 💬 3133 🔖 #outline, #microservices 🗓️ 2025-01-07
    > **Резюме:** Микросервисы и монолиты часто неверно воспринимаются как противоположности, хотя их можно рассматривать как разные способы организации кода. Важно понимать, что код может быть разбит на модули, которые могут находиться в одном репозитории или в нескольких, и это влияет на разработку и развертывание. Гибкость в выборе архитектуры позволяет командам адаптироваться к изменениям и улучшать качество кода.
- [Monolith First](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html) 👤 Martin Fowler 💬 1092 🔖 #microservices 🗓️ 2024-10-07
    > **Резюме:** Successful microservices often start from a monolith that has grown too large. A monolith-first approach allows teams to develop quickly and determine the right boundaries before transitioning to microservices. Starting with microservices can be challenging and may lead to complications if teams lack experience.
- [Microservice Premium](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePremium.html) 👤 Martin Fowler 💬 726 🔖 #microservices 🗓️ 2024-10-07
    > **Резюме:** The microservices architectural style has gained significant attention in recent years, with many teams eager to embrace it without fully understanding the complexities it introduces. This can lead to increased project costs and risks. However, microservices can be a useful approach for handling complex systems that are too difficult to manage as a monolith. Factors such as large teams, multi-tenancy, and the need for independent evolution and scaling can drive the use of microservices. However, it is important to note that not all problems attributed to monoliths are essential to that style, and there are successful organizations that use monolithic architectures. The decision to use microservices should be based on the complexity of the system and the specific needs of the project.
- [Microservice Prerequisites](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePrerequisites.html) 👤 Martin Fowler 💬 660 🔖 #microservices 🗓️ 2024-10-07
    > **Резюме:** To successfully implement a microservices architectural style, certain prerequisites need to be in place. These include the ability to rapidly provision new servers, basic monitoring capabilities to detect and address technical and business issues, and the ability to quickly deploy services to test environments and production. These prerequisites require close collaboration between developers and operations, known as DevOpsCulture, to ensure efficient provisioning, deployment, and incident management. Once these capabilities are established, a system using a handful of microservices can be deployed and tested, allowing for learning and growth before scaling up. These prerequisites are also important for monolithic systems and should be a high priority for software organizations. Going beyond a handful of services requires additional capabilities, such as tracing business transactions, embracing Continuous Delivery, and transitioning to product-centered teams. A Maturity Model may be useful in guiding organizations in their microservice implementations.
- [Микросервисы](https://grishaev.me/microservices/) 👤 grishaev.me 💬 402 🔖 #microservices 🗓️ 2024-10-19
    > **Резюме:** Микросервисы часто разрабатываются без учета их взаимосвязей, что приводит к проблемам с документацией и производительностью. Каждый сервис должен иметь общие стандарты, такие как генерация документации и лимиты запросов, чтобы избежать ошибок. Правильные микросервисы должны быть унифицированы и следовать одной общей структуре.
