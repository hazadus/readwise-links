- [Advent of Code 2024 with Elixir - Part 2: The Better](https://simoncrowe.hashnode.dev/advent-of-code-2024-with-elixir-part-2-the-better) 👤 Simon Crowe 💬 623 🔖 #elixir 🗓️ 2025-01-27
    > **Резюме:** In this article, Simon Crowe explains how he improved his solution for day 6 of Advent of Code 2024 using Elixir. He switched from using a linked list to a MapSet, which made lookups faster and simplified the business logic. For part 2, he adapted his approach to handle cyclic traversals by tracking both position and direction.
- [Programming Elixir 1.6](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/28841812) 👤 Dave Thomas 💬 85727 🔖 #book, #elixir 🗓️ 2025-01-08
    > **Резюме:** In Elixir, module and protocol names start with an uppercase letter, while other identifiers use lowercase letters and underscores. The language allows passing functions around easily, optimizing the use of anonymous functions when possible. Elixir uses an actor model for concurrency, where independent processes can communicate by sending messages without sharing state.
- [Elixir in Action, Third Edition](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/202067289) 👤 Sasa Juric 💬 116155 🔖 #book, #elixir 🗓️ 2025-01-08
    > **Резюме:** Erlang's concurrency model allows for thousands of lightweight processes to run simultaneously, making systems scalable and fault-tolerant. Elixir, which runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM), enables developers to create long-running processes that can handle messages and maintain state efficiently. This book covers essential elements of Elixir and Erlang, including functional programming, the concurrency model, and important behaviors like GenServer and Supervisor.
- [Advent of Code 2024 with Elixir - Part 1: The Good-ish, the Ugly and the Bad](https://simoncrowe.hashnode.dev/advent-of-code-2024-with-elixir-part-1-the-good-ish-the-ugly-and-the-bad) 👤 Simon Crowe 💬 1203 🔖 #elixir 🗓️ 2024-12-26
