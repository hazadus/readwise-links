    > **Резюме:** Obsidian and GTD are both systems that aim to help you organize your thoughts and tasks efficiently. GTD, or "getting things done," focuses on task management, while Obsidian offers a flexible digital platform for capturing commitments. By combining the principles of GTD with the versatility of Obsidian, you can create a personalized system to enhance your productivity and organization.
- [Building a Second Brain and GTD - Obsidian Rocks](https://obsidian.rocks/building-a-second-brain-and-gtd/) 👤 Tim Miller 💬 1606 🔖 #gtd, #pkm, #basb, #productivity 🗓️ 2024-10-27
    > **Резюме:** Building a Second Brain (BASB) by Tiago Forte explores digital file organization, drawing parallels to David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD) system. Both methods focus on capturing, organizing, and distilling information, with BASB emphasizing ideas alongside tasks. Forte simplifies Allen's approach into a "CODE" method, eliminating some steps while adding a unique perspective on distillation and expression. The document outlines a hybrid "CODER" method that combines aspects of both systems to enhance productivity and knowledge management in the digital age.
