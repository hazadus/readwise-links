    > **Резюме:** New managers often struggle to find the right balance between being involved and giving their team autonomy.

- [Burnout ≠ Working Too Much](https://terriblesoftware.org/2024/12/20/burnout-%E2%89%A0-working-too-much/) 👤 Terrible Software 💬 552 🔖 #career, #leaddev, #management 🗓️ 2025-02-13
    > **Резюме:** Burnout is often caused by a lack of purpose and agency in work, rather than just working too much. To prevent burnout, managers should ensure team members have control over their projects and understand the impact of their contributions. Providing alignment, autonomy, and reminders of their work's significance can help keep motivation high.

    > **Резюме:** Engineers sometimes avoid making decisions in discussions, thinking it's safer, but this can lead to bad choices being made by others. It's important for experienced engineers to take a position, even if they’re unsure, to guide the team and prevent poor outcomes. While some hesitation is understandable, refusing to commit can be seen as a lack of courage and responsibility.

    > **Резюме:** Website projects often fail due to confusion over responsibilities, arbitrary deadlines, and content issues. Misunderstandings about who handles tasks can lead to major setbacks. Proper planning and clear communication at the start can help avoid these problems.
- [Ratchet effects determine engineer reputation at large companies](https://www.seangoedecke.com/ratchet-effects/) 👤 seangoedecke.com 💬 1203 🔖 #leaddev, #development 🗓️ 2025-01-28
    > **Резюме:** Engineers build their reputation at large tech companies through a gradual process called the ratchet effect, where they start with low-status tasks and gradually earn higher-status work by delivering successful projects. Their reputation can quickly form but is hard to change, making early successes crucial for long-term recognition. If engineers fail early on, it's challenging to recover, and they may need to switch companies for a fresh start.
- [How I got promoted to staff engineer twice](https://www.seangoedecke.com/staff-engineer-promotions/) 👤 seangoedecke.com 💬 1110 🔖 #career, #leaddev 🗓️ 2025-01-28
    > **Резюме:** In 2021, Sean Goedecke was promoted to staff software engineer at Zendesk and again at GitHub in 2023. To get promoted, engineers need to deliver valuable projects that align with company goals and have supportive managers. It’s often easier to be hired as a staff engineer than to be promoted within a company, so focusing on high-impact work is essential.
- [Why some engineers get trusted with high-impact work](https://www.seangoedecke.com/point-person/) 👤 seangoedecke.com 💬 1676 🔖 #leaddev, #development 🗓️ 2025-01-28
    > **Резюме:** Engineers are trusted with important work by building relationships in "circles of trust" that start with their own team and extend to higher management. To maintain this trust, they must be discreet, communicate effectively at a senior level, and consistently deliver accurate technical information. It's important for engineers to focus on their own management chain and avoid becoming too involved with outside requests that could jeopardize their primary responsibilities.
- [Being Glue](https://www.noidea.dog/glue) 👤 No Idea Blog 💬 4713 🔖 #leaddev, #management, #development 🗓️ 2025-01-28
    > **Резюме:** Many software engineers find themselves doing "glue work," which involves tasks that support team success but can detract from their technical skills. This can lead to career challenges, as individuals may be seen as not technical enough for promotions. It's important for engineers and their managers to have open conversations about balancing glue work with core technical responsibilities to ensure career growth.
- [How to give pushback to leadership](https://leaddev.com/communication/how-give-pushback-leadership) 👤 anastasija 💬 1344 🔖 #leaddev, #outline 🗓️ 2025-01-28

    > **Резюме:** Pushing back against leadership is sometimes necessary to protect a project's success.

- [Glue work considered harmful](https://www.seangoedecke.com/glue-work-considered-harmful) 👤 seangoedecke.com 💬 639 🔖 #leaddev, #outline 🗓️ 2025-01-28
    > **Заметка:** Интересная мысль: делать glue work для проектов, за успех которых ты отвечаешь. Тогда будет оценена на сама glue work, а итоговый успех проекта.
    > **Резюме:** "Glue work" refers to essential but unrecognized tasks that help teams operate efficiently, like updating documents and onboarding new engineers. Companies often overlook this work during promotions, as they prioritize visible feature delivery instead. While glue work is important, it should be done strategically for projects you lead, rather than as a primary focus.
- [Playing politics is how senior engineers protect their team](https://seangoedecke.com/politics-is-your-responsibility/) 👤 seangoedecke.com 💬 640 🔖 #leaddev, #management, #development 🗓️ 2025-01-27
    > **Резюме:** Senior engineers have a responsibility to engage in company politics to support their junior colleagues. By navigating these dynamics, they help junior engineers gain visibility and opportunities for promotion. Ignoring this aspect of the job can harm both the team's success and the career growth of less experienced members.
- [Why are big tech companies so slow?](https://www.seangoedecke.com/difficulty-in-big-tech/) 👤 seangoedecke.com 💬 1254 🔖 #leaddev, #outline 🗓️ 2025-01-27
    > **Заметка:** Учесть при разработке проектов: чем больше накапливается фич, тем сложнее и дольше реализовывать последующие фичи.
    > **Резюме:** Big tech companies are slow because they have many features that interact with each other, making it complex to build and ship new ones. This complexity creates a high cognitive load for engineers, who must balance these features carefully. While some may think big tech engineers are incompetent, the reality is that adding features for profit makes the development process much more challenging.

    > **Резюме:** Sometimes, engineers must say "no" to leadership to ensure project success. Doing this effectively can build trust, but it carries risks if done poorly. It's important to support decision-making without overstepping boundaries.
- [Crushing JIRA tickets is a party trick, not a path to impact](https://www.seangoedecke.com/party-tricks/) 👤 seangoedecke.com 💬 1503 🔖 #leaddev, #outline 🗓️ 2025-01-28
    > **Резюме:** Focusing on JIRA tickets won't lead to real impact or promotions; prioritize the work that aligns with your company's important goals instead. Be willing to drop low-priority tasks and ask yourself regularly if you're working on the most important thing. While suggesting new ideas can be rewarding, it carries risks, so it's safer to support the company's top priorities.
- [Division of Labor](https://third-bit.com/2025/01/08/division-of-labor/) 👤 third-bit.com 💬 846 🔖 #leaddev, #management 🗓️ 2025-01-10
    > **Резюме:** Dividing tasks in a team can lead to unfair work distribution based on social status, often disadvantaging women and people of color. Recommended strategies include feature decomposition, where each member handles the design, coding, testing, and documentation of one feature, promoting fairness and collaboration. Avoid chaotic task assignments, as they can create confusion and lead to unequal contributions among team members.
- [Code Review - Recheck the basics](https://www.better-simple.com/code-review/recheck-the-basics#are-the-migrations-schema-changes-condensed) 👤 https://www.better-simple.com/portfolio/ 💬 423 🔖 #leaddev, #outline 🗓️ 2025-01-06
    > **Резюме:** Code reviews are essential for ensuring that all changes meet engineering standards, including passing automated tests and having proper code coverage. Developers should also check for unnecessary migrations and ensure that all code removals and interface changes are thoroughly updated throughout the codebase. It's important to provide gentle reminders during reviews without judgment, especially if issues have been overlooked.
