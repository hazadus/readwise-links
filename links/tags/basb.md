    > **Резюме:** Creating a universal system for tagging notes is unrealistic and can lead to frustration. Instead, focus on using tags to track the progress of your notes and their specific use cases. Start with simpler organization methods and only add tags retroactively when you understand how your notes will be applied.

    > **Резюме:** Building a Second Brain (BASB) by Tiago Forte explores digital file organization, drawing parallels to David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD) system. Both methods focus on capturing, organizing, and distilling information, with BASB emphasizing ideas alongside tasks. Forte simplifies Allen's approach into a "CODE" method, eliminating some steps while adding a unique perspective on distillation and expression. The document outlines a hybrid "CODER" method that combines aspects of both systems to enhance productivity and knowledge management in the digital age.
