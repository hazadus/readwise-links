- [gRPC API Gateway: Bridging the Gap Between REST and gRPC](https://zuplo.com/blog/2025/04/09/grpc-api-gateway) 👤 Peyman Motrtazavi 💬 2001 🔖 #grpc 🗓️ 2025-04-18
    > **Резюме:** gRPC API Gateway helps connect gRPC services with REST APIs, making it easier for external clients to access high-performance gRPC features. It offers flexible configuration and extensive documentation while enhancing error handling and streaming support. Future improvements include dynamic proxy capabilities and support for multiple programming languages.
- [From net/rpc to gRPC in Go Applications](https://victoriametrics.com/blog/go-net-rpc/) 👤 VictoriaMetrics 💬 20 🔖 #go, #grpc 🗓️ 2024-12-24
    > **Резюме:** The net/rpc package in Go demonstrates basic RPC concepts by establishing TCP connections between clients and servers, using sequence numbers to match requests with responses, and supporting both gob (Go-specific) and JSON codecs for data serialization. While net/rpc is simpler and limited to Go services by default, gRPC offers advanced features like HTTP/2 streaming, cross-language support, and better performance
- [Introduction to gRPC in Go](mailto:reader-forwarded-email/209fa8d8e65c6774b959dc7556e9b07e) 👤 Jon Calhoun 💬 1882 🔖 #go, #grpc 🗓️ 2024-11-05
    > **Резюме:** This text introduces gRPC, an efficient framework for building high-performance microservices using Go. It highlights gRPC's features like strong message structure, bi-directional streaming, and broad language support, which make it suitable for distributed systems. The author also mentions a course for deeper learning about gRPC and its applications.
- [Can gRPC replace REST and WebSockets for Web Application Communication? | gRPC](https://grpc.io/blog/postman-grpcweb/) 👤 Ian Douglas (Sr Developer Advocate, Postman) | Monday, 💬 1791 🔖 #grpc 🗓️ 2024-04-04
    > **Резюме:** gRPC-Web is a library that allows developers to utilize the speed and power of gRPC for client-server communication in web applications, potentially replacing traditional REST and some aspects of WebSockets. It extends the capabilities of gRPC to the browser, enabling direct communication with gRPC services. gRPC-Web calls are strongly-typed and handle serialization/deserialization automatically, reducing the potential for human error. The advantages of gRPC-Web over REST include working with existing services, type safety, efficient serialization, and clear API contracts. To set up a gRPC-Web environment, developers need to define services and message payloads using Protobuf, set up a gRPC backend service, and configure an Envoy proxy. gRPC-Web can replace WebSockets for server-to-client streaming, offering a more efficient and manageable solution. While there is more work and benchmarking needed, gRPC-Web shows promise as an alternative technology for web applications.
