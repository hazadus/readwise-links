Installation involves using Docker, configuring image sizes, and handling errors related to Docker daemon connectivity. The act CLI offers various options like triggering events, listing jobs, running specific jobs, displaying graphs, managing environment variables, and handling secrets, making testing GitHub actions locally more efficient.
