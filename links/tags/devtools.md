    > **Резюме:** The text discusses the author's approach to using the command line, highlighting their preference for productivity over speed. They mention two tools that have helped them on the command line: Fish shell and Starship prompt. Fish is praised for its built-in features that enhance user experience, such as intelligent completion and partial history search. Starship, on the other hand, is described as providing essential information with color in the prompt, based on the project directory. The author encourages readers to explore other developer tools for the command line but recommends starting with Fish and Starship as they are easy, nice, and unobtrusive.
