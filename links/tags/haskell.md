    > **Резюме:** The author, experienced in imperative programming, struggles to learn Haskell and finds its setup complex and frustrating. While he appreciates Haskell's elegance and expressive type system, he feels the learning curve is too steep for practical use. Ultimately, he doubts he will use Haskell for meaningful projects due to its challenges and relative unpopularity.

    > **Резюме:** The document "12 Languages in 12 Months" describes the author's experience of learning 12 different programming languages over the course of a year. Each month had a different theme, such as functional programming or object-oriented programming, and the author shared their thoughts and experiences with each language. They discussed the challenges, benefits, and their overall impressions of each language, highlighting the aspects they enjoyed and those they found less appealing. The author also mentioned developing a Universal Test Runner and incorporating it into the Exercism CLI. Overall, they found the language tour to be a valuable learning experience that expanded their horizons.
