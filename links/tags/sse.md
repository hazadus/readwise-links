- [Server-Sent Events vs WebSockets – How to Choose a Real-Time Data Exchange Protocol](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/server-sent-events-vs-websockets/) 👤 freeCodeCamp.org 💬 5470 🔖 #sse, #websocket 🗓️ 2025-01-06
    > **Резюме:** This article explains the differences between WebSockets and Server-Sent Events (SSE), two protocols for real-time data exchange in web applications. WebSockets allow two-way communication for instant data transfer, making them ideal for chat apps and online games. In contrast, SSE provides one-way communication from the server to the client, which is useful for streaming updates like stock prices.
- [Server-Sent Events (SSE) Are Underrated](https://igorstechnoclub.com/server-sent-events-sse-are-underrated/) 👤 Igor's Techno Club 💬 736 🔖 #sse, #outline 🗓️ 2024-12-27
    > **Резюме:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) offer a simple way for servers to send updates to clients over HTTP, unlike the more complex WebSockets. SSE is efficient and works well with existing infrastructure, making it a great choice for applications like real-time news feeds and stock tickers. Despite being underrated, SSE's one-way communication can be sufficient for many use cases.
- [How to Implement Server-Sent Events in Go](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-implement-server-sent-events-in-go/) 👤 Alex Pliutau 💬 1021 🔖 #go, #sse 🗓️ 2024-08-29
    > **Резюме:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) allow servers to send real-time updates to clients over a single HTTP connection, making it simpler than WebSockets. This article explains how to implement SSE in Go, including practical examples and best practices for building efficient real-time applications. Key benefits of SSE include automatic reconnection, native browser support, and reduced overhead.
