- [Make resilient Go net/http servers using timeouts, deadlines and context cancellation](https://ieftimov.com/posts/make-resilient-golang-net-http-servers-using-timeouts-deadlines-context-cancellation/) 👤 Ilija Eftimov 💬 2940 🔖 #go 🗓️ 2024-12-16
    > **Резюме:** Timeouts are an important aspect of developing net/http servers in Go. There are different types of timeouts, including client and server timeouts. In this article, the focus is on server-side timeouts. The net/http package in Go provides various timeout configurations for servers, such as ReadTimeout, WriteTimeout, IdleTimeout, and ReadHeaderTimeout. However, these timeout values function as TCP connection deadlines rather than HTTP timeouts. To implement efficient timeouts for handlers, the TimeoutHandler function from the net/http package can be used. This function runs a handler within a given time limit and returns a proper timeout error if the handler exceeds the limit. Additionally, the context package in Go can be used to handle timeouts and request cancellations, allowing for better control and resource management in server applications.
