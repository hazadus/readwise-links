This method helps identify hard-to-find issues that traditional testing might miss, improving overall software reliability.
- [Jeff Triplett's Micro.blog - How to test with Django and pytest fixtures](https://micro.webology.dev/2024/02/05/how-to-test.html) 👤 Jeff Triplett 💬 351 🔖 #django, #pytest, #testing 🗓️ 2024-02-08
    > **Резюме:** Here are some notes on how I like to write tests for a Django app that tests a model down to a view.
Django Model + pytest Fixture This part is a mouthful, but I prefer to use the Model Bakery library to automatically create instances of Django models (aka a fixture) with good test data instead of manually creating them. This approach saves time and adds some variety to my test data.
- [Three pytest Features You Will Love | The PyCharm Blog](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2024/02/pytest-features/) 👤 Helen Scott 💬 840 🔖 #pytest, #python, #testing 🗓️ 2024-02-13

- [Dec 8 Suite smells: undertesting and overtesting](https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/undertesting-overtesting) 👤 John Arundel 💬 2165 🔖 #go, #outline, #testing 🗓️ 2024-12-08
    > **Резюме:** The author discusses the importance of testing not just if code works, but also ensuring it doesn't produce unwanted results. He highlights that tests should check both preconditions and postconditions to avoid misleading outcomes. Additionally, he warns against overtesting, which can make tests unnecessarily complex and fragile.
- [Making Use of Code Coverage | Epic Web Dev](https://www.epicweb.dev/making-use-of-code-coverage) 👤 Artem Zakharchenko 💬 2018 🔖 #testing 🗓️ 2024-02-14
    > **Резюме:** Code coverage is a metric that measures how much of a tested system is run during testing. It can be a useful tool for identifying missed logic, dead code, and gaining more context on what is being tested in an application. However, code coverage should not be the sole driver of testing efforts and should be approached with caution. It is important to prioritize intention-driven testing and understand the limitations and caveats of code coverage. Misuse of code coverage can lead to unreliable results and misguided testing strategies. Ultimately, code coverage should be used as a tool to aid in auditing software and finding problematic areas, rather than as a metric to drive testing decisions.
- [The True Purpose of Testing | Epic Web Dev](https://www.epicweb.dev/the-true-purpose-of-testing) 👤 Artem Zakharchenko 💬 644 🔖 #testing 🗓️ 2024-02-15
    > **Резюме:** The true purpose of automated tests is to validate the intention behind the system. Tests become useful when they focus on the intention rather than the implementation. Many tests fail to fulfill their purpose because they focus on implementation details instead of validating what the code is intended to do. By treating implementation details as a means to an end and focusing on the larger intention at hand, the value of automated testing can be unlocked. It is important to always test the intention behind the system to ensure that it functions without fault.
- [Common Testing Mistakes](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-testing-mistakes) 👤 kentcdodds.com 💬 992 🔖 #testing 🗓️ 2024-02-15
    > **Резюме:** The text discusses common testing mistakes, such as testing implementation details and aiming for 100% code coverage, which may not necessarily increase confidence in the codebase. The author emphasizes the importance of writing tests that focus on critical parts of the application to ensure confidence, rather than just increasing code coverage. Additionally, the text highlights the need for efficient end-to-end testing strategies to enhance test reliability and speed.
- [Testing Implementation Details](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/testing-implementation-details) 👤 kentcdodds.com 💬 2145 🔖 #testing 🗓️ 2024-02-15
    > **Резюме:** Testing implementation details can lead to fragile tests that break easily when code changes. It's better to write tests that focus on how the software behaves from a user's perspective, rather than its internal workings. Using tools like React Testing Library helps create more reliable tests that are resilient to changes in the implementation.
