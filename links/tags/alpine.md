- [Alpine.js Crash Course #8 - Loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OftSKFk0_Bc) 👤 Net Ninja 🔖 #alpine 🗓️ 2025-02-19
    > **Резюме:** In this lesson, we learn about the `x-for` directive in Alpine.js, which allows us to create loops in templates. This is useful for dynamically generating elements, like dropdown options, from an array of data instead of hardcoding them. The video also highlights the importance of using a unique key for each item in the loop for better tracking by Alpine.js.
- [Alpine.js Crash Course #7 - Using x-if](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MiNCCWw0ZI) 👤 Net Ninja 🔖 #alpine 🗓️ 2025-02-18
    > **Резюме:** In this lesson, we learned how to display error messages for form validation using the x-if directive in Alpine.js. We created a template tag that conditionally shows error messages only if they exist in the errors object. This allows users to see which inputs need correcting when they submit the form.
- [Alpine.js Crash Course #6 - Form Reset & Validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQmqeVRboCE) 👤 Net Ninja 🔖 #alpine 🗓️ 2025-02-18
    > **Резюме:** In this lesson, we learn how to validate a form using Alpine.js and handle errors for each input field. If the validation passes, we reset the form and log a success message; otherwise, we display specific error messages. The tutorial also demonstrates how to reset the form using JavaScript's reset method.
- [Alpine.js Crash Course #3 - Attribute Binding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlHr3TltNB0) 👤 Net Ninja 🔖 #alpine 🗓️ 2025-02-12
    > **Резюме:** In this lesson, we learn about attribute binding in Alpine.js, which allows us to dynamically change HTML attributes like class. We use this to provide real-time feedback on input fields, such as changing the helper text color to red when users approach the character limit. By binding classes conditionally, we can alert users as they type too many characters.
- [Alpine.js Crash Course #2 - Models & Forms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-hDbPEVogA) 👤 Net Ninja 🔖 #alpine 🗓️ 2025-02-12
    > **Резюме:** In this lesson, the author demonstrates how to use Alpine.js to create a sign-up form with various input fields. They explain how to bind data from these fields to properties in a data object using the X-model directive. This allows the form to dynamically display user input and manage state effectively.
- [Alpine.js Crash Course #1 - Alpine Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3Cso8JDUys) 👤 Net Ninja 🔖 #alpine 🗓️ 2025-02-12
    > **Резюме:** The video "Alpine.js Crash Course #1 - Alpine Basics" by Net Ninja introduces Alpine.js, a lightweight JavaScript framework similar to jQuery. It explains how to use Alpine.js to add interactivity to web pages, such as updating values and responding to user events. The tutorial covers basic syntax and demonstrates how to create a simple counter feature using Alpine.js directives.
- [Alpine.js makes client side interactivity stupidly simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLB7r8neQvE) 👤 Dreams of Code 🔖 #alpine 🗓️ 2025-02-05
    > **Резюме:** Alpine.js simplifies adding interactivity to web pages, like toggling the visibility of a side menu. It allows users to easily bind actions, such as clicking a button to show or hide the menu, using simple HTML attributes. With Alpine.js, developers can enhance user experience without relying heavily on complex JavaScript.
