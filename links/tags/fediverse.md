    > **Резюме:** Mastodon is a Twitter-like social network that has gained popularity among the Django community as an alternative to Twitter. The platform allows users to connect with others, discover news, discuss issues, and share conference photos. To join the Django community on Mastodon, users can sign up on a server, such as Fosstodon, which is dedicated to free and open-source software. It is also important to support the server admins financially and set up a profile with relevant hashtags. Users can follow Django-related accounts and hashtags to engage with the community, and there are various apps available for accessing Mastodon. Additionally, a tool called Fediview can generate a digest of the feed to ensure users don't miss interesting posts.
