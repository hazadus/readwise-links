    > **Резюме:** CCL, a DJ known for their unconventional methods, discusses their approach to DJing in an interview. They focus on texture and mood rather than genre or BPM, and aim to create an emotional response through their sets. They use techniques such as tempo changes and mixing beatless tracks to create unique narratives and storytelling experiences. CCL also discusses the importance of knowing tracks well and being able to connect with the music they play. They use a pedal to help string tracks together and create seamless transitions. Overall, CCL's DJing style is experimental and focused on creating immersive and evocative experiences for the listener.
